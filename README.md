# radiation methods
This repository is a collection of several programs used to simulate radiation by electrons in various fields

## Clara2
Clara2 is a code borrowed from [another project](https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/clara2).

After generating a trajectory with the field-solver enter the commands
```
./executable
./process_data
```
to generate the spectrum of your trajectory 


## field-solver
An integration code to produce electron trajectories for various fields

## splice-script
A collection of scripts to study the time evolution of radiation
